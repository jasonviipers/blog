# Integrating AI Chat with MCP Support

Modern web applications benefit greatly from intelligent assistance. By integrating an AI chatbot with Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, we can create a more interactive and helpful user experience.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and services. It enables:

- **Tool Integration**: Connect AI to external APIs and services
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain state across interactions
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new capabilities
- **Standardization**: Consistent interface across different tools

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Chat Provider Setup

The chat system uses React Context for state management:

\`\`\`tsx
interface ChatContextType {
  messages: Message[]
  isOpen: boolean
  isLoading: boolean
  openChat: () => void
  closeChat: () => void
  sendMessage: (content: string) => Promise<void>
  clearChat: () => void
}

export function ChatProvider({ children }: ChatProviderProps) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([])
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

  // Implementation details...
}
\`\`\`

### 2. MCP Server Configuration

Define available tools and servers:

\`\`\`typescript
const MCP_SERVERS = {
  blog: {
    name: "blog-server",
    description: "Access to blog posts and content",
    tools: ["search_posts", "get_post_content", "get_author_info"]
  },
  contact: {
    name: "contact-server", 
    description: "Contact and communication tools",
    tools: ["send_email", "schedule_meeting", "get_contact_info"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. AI Integration with Vercel AI SDK

Use the AI SDK for seamless model integration:

\`\`\`typescript
import { generateText } from "ai"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai"

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  system: systemPrompt,
  messages: messages.map(msg => ({
    role: msg.role,
    content: msg.content,
  })),
  maxTokens: 500,
})
\`\`\`

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Assistance

The AI can help users:
- Find relevant blog posts
- Explain technical concepts
- Provide coding assistance
- Guide users to appropriate resources

### 2. Contact Integration

Seamless transition from chat to direct contact:
- Built-in contact form
- Email integration capabilities
- Meeting scheduling support
- Direct author communication

### 3. Context Awareness

The AI maintains context about:
- Blog content and topics
- User preferences and history
- Available tools and capabilities
- Conversation flow and intent

## User Experience Design

### Zen-Inspired Interface

The chat interface follows the blog's zen aesthetic:

\`\`\`tsx
// Clean, minimal design
<div className="w-full max-w-md h-[600px] bg-paper dark:bg-ink border border-ink/10 dark:border-paper/10 rounded-lg shadow-2xl">
  {/* Chat content */}
</div>
\`\`\`

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Familiar shortcuts for power users:
- `Ctrl+K`: Open chat
- `Escape`: Close chat
- `Enter`: Send message

### Responsive Design

Works seamlessly across devices:
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Adaptive layout and sizing

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling

- Messages are not stored permanently
- Contact form data is handled securely
- User privacy is respected
- No tracking or analytics on conversations

### API Security

- Rate limiting on endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure environment variable handling
- Error handling without data exposure

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced MCP Integration

Potential additions:
- Calendar integration
- File sharing capabilities
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Advanced search and filtering

### AI Capabilities

Enhanced features:
- Code review assistance
- Technical writing help
- Learning path recommendations
- Personalized content suggestions

## Getting Started

To use the AI chat:

1. **Click the chat button** in the bottom-right corner
2. **Use Ctrl+K** to open chat quickly
3. **Ask questions** about blog content or development topics
4. **Switch to contact form** for direct communication
5. **Use keyboard shortcuts** for efficient navigation

The AI assistant is designed to be helpful, knowledgeable, and respectful of the zen philosophy that guides this blog.
